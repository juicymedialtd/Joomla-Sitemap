Joomla Sitemap
=============

This is a very simple native sitemap component for Joomla 1.5.4. The component is a BETA release (now at v2) and now has some extremely useful admin functionality.

Future Enhancements
-------
The current development lists all menus that have been defined in the Joomla admin area, future enhancements include:

* show external links with icon
* optional visual interface of mappings
* full CSS control of the output Component Usage: To make this component function, simply install the supplied ZIP file using the Joomla admin area. After successful installation, create a menu link to the component, selecting the default view. Google sitemap generation is presently done by creating a menu link as above and then on the frontend visiting the link. This will have now created a "sitemap.xml" file in the root of the Joomla directory (directory and file permissions dependant). If required you can now remove the link (or simply unpublish).

NB: Having been designed for Joomla 1.5 it does not require legacy mode to be enabled. Please keep this page bookmarked for future updates.
